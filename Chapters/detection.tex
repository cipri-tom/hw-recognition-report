\chapter{Text detection}
\label{ch:detection}

The challenges presented in \cref{sec:challenges} make it clear that a classical approach is unsuitable for our problem. As such, we direct our attention towards the modern, robust architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) \citep{conv_nets}. In particular, we take inspiration from the great advances in object detection and classification \citep{image_net} and we will treat text like a regular object which can be found anywhere in the image. Moreover

and provides high robustness with regards to the type of the document.

This chapter presents how we approach the problem of missing labelled data, a first trial at the problem using the Faster R-CNN architecture \citep{faster_rcnn}, and an improvement on it using the CTPN architecture \citep{ctpn}.

\section{Producing annotated data}
As it is well known by now \citep{massive_data}, deep neural networks need a large amount of annotated data
