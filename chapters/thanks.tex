\large
I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr Mathieu Salzmann for his guidance, valuable advice and fruitful discussions. His willingness to give his time so generously has been very much appreciated.

I am also particularly grateful for the assistance given by Patrick Jayet and for his lessons in solving problems pragmatically. My special thanks are extended to the staff of AXA Engineering lab for sharing their expertise with me and for making the office a great place to learn.

Finally, I wish to thank Ana Ciolan and my family for their continuous support and encouragement throughout my studies.
