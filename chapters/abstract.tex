\large
	This project is a first step in information extraction from complex, heterogeneous and handwritten business forms, with the aim of speeding up their processing. It tackles the main problems of handwriting detection and recognition in the challenging context of no labelled data.

	Our work adapts well known deep learning architectures in order to solve each of them separately, namely the successful Faster R-CNN for detection and the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for transcription. We carry out several experiments on each task which prove that we can greatly benefit from transfer learning to avoid the high cost of data labelling. In addition, we show new data generation techniques which further help in this regard and which allow us to inspect the important factors that influence the model's performance.

	Finally, we assemble the two parts together into a proof of concept system that is able to detect handwritten text in highly challenging documents and to transcribe some of it correctly.
