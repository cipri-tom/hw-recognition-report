In conclusion, we proved that \FRCNN{} is able to learn handwriting specific features and it can use them to detect handwritten text reasonably well. For our model the confidence score of the detected boxes is less helpful for selecting high quality ones, but this is a small problem since false negatives can be filtered at a later time. Alternatively, it is likely that fine tuning on a subset of \ds{TEST} would aid the model to better distinguish between real text and text-like examples. We also note from results like \autoref{fig:template_bin_detection} that the model learnt to detect bounding boxes taller than the actual text due to inaccurate training examples.
